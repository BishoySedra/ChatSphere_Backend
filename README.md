### API Documentation

For detailed information about the API endpoints and usage, please refer to the [API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/32763635/2sA35MzzRV#e48a33f9-b1ed-4b32-8e2e-304ab8320391).

### Steps to Run

Currently, there are three environments available: `dev`, `test`, and `local`.

To use a database, you must specify one of the available environments in your script. Here's how to do it:

- For testing:

  ```bash
  npm run dev -- --environment=test
  ```

- For development:

  ```bash
  npm run dev -- --environment=dev
  ```

- For the local environment:

  ```bash
  npm run dev -- --environment=local
  ```

Make sure to apply the same approach for other scripts like `npm test` or `npm start`.

### Test modules

Test modules using the *jest* library for all APIs are available in the `tests` directory, to run the test use

```bash
npm run test -- --enviroment=test tests/{fileName}.test.js
# Example
npm run test -- --enviroment=test tests/groups.test.js 
```

### Note about the local environment

A docker compose file `docker-compose.yaml` is present this configures MongoDB in a docker conatiner with port mapping and volume mapping to save the data, change username and password to your preference.

Add the connection string to your `.env` file in the `MONGODB_CONNECTION_URL_LOCAL` field.

It should be like this

```mongosh
mongodb://<username>:<password>@localhost:27017/ChatSphere
```

**Remove the `<>` around the username and password**
